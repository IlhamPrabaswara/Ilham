Hello and welcome to my personal website!

Hi! it's me, Ilham. I had a lot of free time lately, so I decided to learn new technologies. This time I decided to learn Next.js and made this personal blog.
I used to learn React from a bootcamp early 2021 and decided to learn its framework. I once had a portfolio website with HTML, CSS with a spice of Vanilla JS.
Now I decided to revamp with React and Next.js and deployed with Vercel.
